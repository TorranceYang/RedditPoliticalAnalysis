## Comment Generator

The files for this are in `/comment_generator/`. 

With this gigantic corpus of data that we had in BigQuery, we wanted to run sum standard text generation to see what comments are like from different subreddits. For this we used [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify). 

It'd be interesting to run this on the entire corpus of data we pulled, but with the amount of data we have and the cost to query the BigQuery database, we wrote a script `generate_corpuses.py` that instead pulls 100,000 random comments from a particular subreddit and saves it into a file. Then you can run the other file `generate_comments.py` with the file as an input to generate some comments.

**Using generate_corpuses.py**

```
usage: generate_corpuses.py [-h] [--subreddit SUBREDDIT]

Generate the text corpuses to generate Markov chains from

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --subreddit SUBREDDIT, -s SUBREDDIT
                        Input a subreddit you want to generate from
                        (The_Donald, politics, SandersForPresident,
                        hillaryclinton)

```

**Example**

```sh
python generate_corpuses.py -s The_Donald
```

**Using generate_comments.py**

```
usage: generate_comments.py [-h] --file FILE [--num NUM] [--length LENGTH]

Generate the comments

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --file FILE, -f FILE  Input the file you want to generate from
  --num NUM, -n NUM     Number of comments you want to generate
  --length LENGTH, -l LENGTH
                        Number of characters per comment to generate
```

**Example**

```sh
python generate_comments.py -f The_Donald.txt -n 1000
```
